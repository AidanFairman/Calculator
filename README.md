# Welcome to calculator

### Summary

Originally, this was an assignment for one of my classes to demonstrate the memento design pattern. During this assignment, I challenged myself to code a GUI and provide functionality that I hadn't learned yet.

This calculator is written in C++ using Win32 forms. It operates much like the older built-in Windows calculator. It was designed to work with the keyboard, so the user can use their number keys or numpad to interface with the calculator.

One thing that is noticable about the calculator is the very old Windows 98 look of it. I spent hours trying to get the current Windows theme to apply to the GUI, including following some online tutorials, but nothing would change the way it looked. The GUI is functional, just not very pretty

### Try it out

There is a CalculatorWithUndo.exe in the [root folder](https://github.io/AidanFairman/Calculator) that you should be able to run. The calculator is functional for any basic arithmetic, and includes undo functionality. The display shows how far the user can undo before reaching the starting 0 value.
